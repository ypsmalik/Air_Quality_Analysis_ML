# Air_Quality_Analysis_ML
This project takes into account pollutants like CO, SO2, NH3, NH2, CO2 and Ozone to measure the air quality in different regions of delhi (38 regions).

Air pollution can be defined as the contamination of air by any physical, chemical or biological agent which modifies the natural characteristics of nature and is detrimental to human health and the planet. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), almost 99% of the global population breathes air that exceeds WHO guideline limits and contains high levels of pollutants, with low- and middle-income countries suffering from the highest exposures each year due to air pollution nearly seven million deaths occur around the world. The air pollution level in Delhi, the capital territory of India, is in a worse state. According to a WHO survey of 1,650 world cities, and a survey of 7,000 world cities by the US-based Health Effects Institute in August 2022, is the worst of any major city in the world. India's Ministry of Earth Sciences published a research paper in October 2018 attributing almost 41% to vehicular emissions, 21.5% to dust and 18% to industries. Air quality index of Delhi is generally in the Good (0–50), Satisfactory (51–100), and Moderate (101–200) levels between March to September, and then it drastically deteriorates to Poor (201–300), Severe (301–400), or Hazardous (401–500+) levels during October to February.
